# TightBindingHamiltonian_Si
This is code to plot the band structure of diamond structure Si run in the
UBUNTU Python IDE, "SPYDER" which uses the "numpy" and "matplotlib" modules 
among others.
The code involves generation of the tight binding Hamiltonian of diamond 
structure Si from first principles, solving for and sorting for the real 
parts of the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian that were plotted against kpoints.
